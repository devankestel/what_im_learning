  * [x] [DataCamp: Importing Data In Python (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-1) | `* * * * *`
    * This course made me smile. I got to briefly revisit old friends like MATLAB, and make new friends with file formats such as HD5 with actual LIGO data! It was also good to know that I can easily grab data out of any SQL database, even if that database is also being used to interface with a different language/framework for CRUD app purposes. pandas is a very powerful library, and I have a feeling that even once I've mastered the entire curriculum on DataCamp, I'll still have only scratched the surface.
