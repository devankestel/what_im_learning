# What I'm Learning
As software developers we must all be continuous, asynchronous learners to thrive. This repo is a daily journal documenting the learning resources I consume.
***
## Format
This repo is organized into a markdown file per week (see Entry Links section of this README). Each file consists of a simple list of links to learning resources used each day along with a star rating (1-5) and any additional notes. It is mainly for my own record keeping, but perhaps you will find some resources that are also useful to you.
