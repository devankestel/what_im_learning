## Friday

* [x] [Why Haskell](http://jdabbs.com/why-haskell/) by James Dabbs | `* * * *`
  * Succinct article by TIY Rails instructor in DC on Haskell as a first or second language. Especially agree with the point that constrained learning often leads to creativity.
* [x] [YDKJS: Scopes & Closures CH3 - Function vs. Block Scope](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md) | `* * * * *`
  * You Don't Know JS continues to be excellent at helping demystify javascript. I learned that there are 3 different ways to write IIFEs, vars in catch blocks have block scope automatically, and otherwise block scope can be enabled using an ES6 let declaration.

## Sunday

* [x] [Egghead.io: Start Using Elm to Build Web Apps](https://egghead.io/courses/start-using-elm-to-build-web-applications?utm_source=drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=elm-for-web-apps) | `* * * *`
  * Good guide for the basics of Elm, but not the first guide I would pick if I was brand new to the language. Reinforces concepts on Elm's type system, anonymous functions, currying, HTML in Elm, and function composition. The pace is fast and great for a review.
* [x] [YDKJS: Scopes & Closures CH4 - Hoisting](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch4.md) | `* * * *`
  * Hoisting only applies to declarations that happen at compile time - not to assignments that are evaluated at execution. Hoisting now makes a lot more sense after having learned the basics on JS lexing and compiling. I also didn't know that function declarations are hoisted above var declarations. While multiple var declarations are ignored, multiple function declarations replace one another.
* [x] [YDKJS: Scopes & Closures CH5 - Scope Closure](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch5.md) | `* * * *`
  * The most complex chapter I have read thus far. I now have a better idea of why closures are useful, how not to screw them up when writing a block (use let if possible!), and how they are used to make modules with Public APIs. I hope future chapters utilize the information in this one, so that I can get more practice parsing through code snippets with complex closures and hopefully avoid gotchas in my code. Learning about how the ES6 modules evolved from the previous version has enhanced my understanding of past React/Redux work.
* [x] [YDKJS: Scopes & Closures Appendix A - Dynamic Scope](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/apA.md) | `* * * * *`
  * Concise example of how JS would work if scoped dynamically. Sometimes seeing contrast can solidify a concept better than repeated examples of the concept itself.
