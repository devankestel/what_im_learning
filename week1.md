* [x] [Why Haskell](http://jdabbs.com/why-haskell/) by James Dabbs | `* * * *`
  * Succinct article by TIY Rails instructor in DC on Haskell as a first or second language. Especially agree with the point that constrained learning often leads to creativity.
* [x] [YDKJS: Scopes & Closures CH3 - Function vs. Block Scope](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md) | `* * * * *`
  * You Don't Know JS continues to be excellent at helping demystify javascript. I learned that there are 3 different ways to write IIFEs, vars in catch blocks have block scope automatically, and otherwise block scope can be enabled using an ES6 let declaration.
