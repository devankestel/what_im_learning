## Friday

* [x] [DataCamp: Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) | `* * * * *`
  * NGL, the Deep Learning talk at [last week's](week3.md) OPUG meetup inspired me to get back into Python learing mode. Seeing that Numpy arrays operate in an element-wise fashion by default gave me fond memories of Matlab from college. This was a great intro to the basics. Interactive learning platforms make finding the motivation to continue learning easy.

## Saturday, Sunday

* [x] [DataCamp: Intermediate Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science) | `* * * * *`
  * It was good to see both the concept of data frames and the beginnings of rudimentary statistics (read: histograms) in Python. I am happy about how similar Python and R are in their formatting of data for the same types of analysis. I'm glad Data Camp finally produced enough of a suite of Python courses that they are worth pursuing as a track. I intend to continue moving forward.

## Monday, Tuesday

* [x] [DataCamp: Python Data Science Toolbox](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-1) | `* * * * *`
  * Interesting course particularly after having read about JS Scopes and Closures in YDKJS. Python closures behave almost identically, although there are some major differences in scoping options. Also, nice to see some functional concepts with the lambdas section. That said, billing this course as a "Data Toolbox" seems a bit of a misnomer. These are general Python skills that any dev will need, whether data scientist, CRUD app dev, IoT, etc.

## Wednesday

* [x] [Building custom DOM Event Handlers in Elm](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/building-custom-dom-event-handlers-in-elm) [by Joel Quenneville](https://twitter.com/joelquen) | `* * * * *`
  * Concise and clear article on how to handle events when it is something beyond the functions available in the `Html.events` package.
