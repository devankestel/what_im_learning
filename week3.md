* [x] [Functional Programming in Haskell by University of Glasgow: Week 6](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell/) | `* * * *`
  * The final week of this course has certainly cranked things up to 11. I found the type classes and lambda calculus lessons fairly straightforward, though I need more practice and memorization of the lambda calculus rules. The examples of lambdas all the way down were fascinating, but I will need a few more read throughs before I really internalize the material. The same with monads. This chapter feels like, "look at all the advanced things you'll do someday!" rather than, "and these are the final things you should master as a beginner." Next Step: Seek out further Haskell resources for concept reinforcement and maybe learn some category theory.

## Monday

* [x] [RubyConf 2016: Composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwo7ZTHS8Wg) [by James Dabbs](https://twitter.com/jamesdabbs) | `* * * * *`
  * Lots of beautiful Haskell in this talk, but in the end we get to a monad-like structure in Ruby! That said, getting ruby to behave compositionally in terms of objects takes a lot more leg work than I had imagined. Currying may come out of the box, but composition is about more than just partial application here or there.

## Tuesday

* [x] [Orlando Python User Group: Deep Learning](http://enriquegortiz.com/files/DeepLearningTutorial.pptx) | `* * * * *`
  * I didn't have a very good idea of what differentiated deep learning from machine learning before this talk. Enrique and Afshin presented the topic in a way that was accessible and engaging. While I'm aware that true mastery of these techniques will take much more study, the ability to get started with a small set of training data, a Python library, and my laptop, has me excited to see where I can apply deep learning in my own apps.

## Wednesday

* [x] [Elm Orlando Meetup: Working With Input and Subscriptions](https://github.com/ElmOrlando/ElmOrlando/blob/master/web/elm/Demos/MouseFollow.elm) [by AJ Foster](https://twitter.com/austin_j_foster) | `* * * * *`
  * Elm meetups are pure joy, and this week's presentation by AJ was no exception. His review of last month's live code was the perfect amount of refresher before getting into this month's task. Even though I am always nervous when I first step up to the keyboard, I think mob coding is officially my favorite way to learn new skills and to collaborate.

## Thursday

* [x] [RubyConf 2016: Why Recursion Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhwG2B77fQk) [by James Coglan](https://blog.jcoglan.com/) | `* * * * *`
  * Haskell strikes again at RubyConf! The idea of having ruby behave in a declarative manner is cool, but I'm not entirely certain what the practical applications would be for implementing this infrastructure. I'm sure there are some apps that go beyond standard CRUD where this approach would be beneficial, but careful selection is paramount, otherwise time cost may be too high.
* [x] [RubyConf 2016: Ruby versus the Titans of FP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25u-pp-7PHE) [by Cassandra Cruz](https://github.com/lambdatastic) | `* * * * *`
  * It was inspiring to see that many functional concepts in JS, Haskell, and Clojure can be directly applied to Ruby. The fact that this is the 3rd talk I've seen from RubyConf that contains Haskell makes me smile. While I don't think I'm at a level yet where I would make useful contributions to Cassandra's `Reductio` gem, the possibility of utilizing a Ramda-like gem is exciting!
